# Stop 1: Welcome

## What Is This Repository?

This is a **credit card lending platform** - but that's not why you're here.

You're here because this entire codebase was built using **intelligent Engineering (iE)** - a framework for leveraging AI (specifically Claude Code) throughout the software development lifecycle. Every commit, every design decision, every test was created with AI assistance.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tour, you'll understand:

1. **How to structure documentation** so AI can actually help you
2. **How TDD works with AI** - the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
3. **The workflow** that makes AI-assisted development practical
4. **How to onboard to a codebase** by just... asking questions

## Who Is This For?

- **Skeptics**: You've tried AI coding tools and found them underwhelming. Fair. This might change your mind.
- **Curious developers**: You want to see how AI assistance works on a real project, not a toy example.
- **Team leads**: You're evaluating whether to adopt AI tools and want to see patterns that work.

## The Credit Card Domain

Why credit cards? Because it's complex:
- PCI compliance requirements
- Fraud detection
- Billing cycles and statement generation
- Multiple modules with clear boundaries

If AI-assisted development works here, it works on your project too.

## How to Navigate

Each stop will tell you:
- **What to look at** - specific files or commits
- **Why it matters** - the principle behind it
- **Try it** - something you can do right now
